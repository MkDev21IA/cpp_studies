# C++ Studies

## Introduction
This repository exists just to keep me motivated through my studies in the world of C++ Language. When I had the discipline of Applied Programmation at 6th Semester, wasn't sufficient to me just do a script, compile, execute and delete after that.

This work contains all exercise lists of that discipline. Hope you like it!

## First steps to program in C++

First of all you need to download and install an IDE. I recommend Visual Studio, but it has a lot of IDEs in the world at all...

After, to compile a code, you must install a compiler (I use GCC).

For each one of these steps, google it.

## The library ```<iostream>```

I think this is the most important library in C++, is this library who permit funcionalities for input and output operations using streams.

With std::cin you can read a data from the user and with std::cout its possible to display data. Others objets are cerr, clog, etc...
